<h1>Card Sorting -- NASA Moon Website</h1>
<h2>Process & Findings</h2>

<p>During the 4 card sortings (including mine) of the <b>NASA moon website</b>, the following similarities were found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many sorters moved the LADEE information from any section of NASA's site to some sort of "projects" section.</li>
<li>Sections about moon songs, any sort of pictures, and any sort of video tended to have been grouped into a "media" section.</li>
<li>Information about Neil Armstrong, past missions, and the general "About the Moon" information was most likely grouped with "History/Info".</li>
<li> "Strategic Partners", "Get Involved", and "People" from the NASA site was often organized together. Also included is the NASALunar Science Forum, and education materials originally from "About the Moon". I personally labeled this grouping "Community".</li>
<li>Many common Outliers between sorters were from the "Moon Toolkit" section from the website. Many items linked to LADEE information were decided on as outliers. I think this is perhaps because the sortees didn't understand the purpose of these cards and how they relate to LADEE.</li>
</ul>

<p>These were the common things found during the card sorting activity. The first two times the card sort was done I did a poor job at explaining what exactly was being done, so my sortees asked a lot of questions, and didn't quite understand exactly what they were doing, or were overwhelmed by the number of cards.
