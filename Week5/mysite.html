<h1>Card Sorting -- My Website</h1>
<h2>About My Website</h2>
<p>For a while now I've played around with the idea of hosting my own website to include my resume, some sort of portfolio, and other information about myself/what I've been up to. Whether to create just a professional website, or an all encompassing website with professional material included is still up for debate. Regardless, now seems as good a time as any to start! </p>
<h2>Process & Findings</h2>
<p>During the 4 card sortings (including mine) of <b>my website</b>, the following similarities were found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorters agreed that the portfolio and the resume should be grouped together.</li>
<li>Sorters were split on whether the main page should be populated with "About Me" info or with the "What-I've-Been-Up-To" info. </li>
<li>Sorters agreed that a section for sharing recorded music of mine should be a main section of the website.</li>
<li>Few/no outliers were selected by a sortee.</li>
</ul>

<p>This sort was much less comprehensive than the NASA sort. I had a much smaller amount of information than the NASA sort, and the content was published after doing the NASA Moon card sort so I think that the material was much more abbreviated and less ambiguous. Also, there wasn't any content that wasn't understood by the sorters unlike in the NASA sort.
