				<h1>About me</h1>
            	<p>
                	My name is Maxwell Brown. <br><br>
                    
                    I'm an avid Lions Fan, an enjoyer of video games, a musician, and an athletic.<br><br>
                    
                    I was born on June 22, 1992. I grew up in Royal Oak MI and graduated Royal Oak High School in 2010. While at Royal Oak High School I played 4 years of Lacrosse as a defender, Wrestled for 3 years in the 152lbs and 145lbs weight classes, and played 1 year of Tennis at 3 doubles. I also had 4 years of Choir, 3 of them in the A Capella Choir and another in our schools Chamber Singers choir. I acted in the ROHS production of Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods". I also spent 4 years of High School as a part of the ROHS Student Council.<br><br>
            	
                	I came to MSU in the Fall Semester of 2010 with an undecided major looking to be a Civil Engineer, but didn't enjoy that very much. My Sophomore year I switched my major to a B.S. Media & Information, and added a Computer Science Minor and an IT Specialization. My Freshman and Sophomore years of college I rowed with the MSU Club Crew Team and made a lot of friends, and had a lot of fun. After leaving the rowing team, I got a job working at Linton Hall as a computer assistant, and joined the IT Leaders group. I'm looking forward to graduating the Spring of 2014 with my B.S. Media & Information, an IT Specialization, and a nearly-finished Computer Science minor. <br><br>
