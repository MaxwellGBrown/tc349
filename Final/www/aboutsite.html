				<h1>About this site</h1>
            	<p>
                	This site was made for my TC349 -- Client Side Web Development class as a final project. I wanted to do an "about me" website from the bottom up, and write the Javascript by hand. I spent a little bit learning how to use JQueury from <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">http://www.codecademy.com</a> and then applied it to the concept of my design. Originally I wanted to do a box-model where the grids of the website overlapped when you highlighted them, but during coding I didn't like the way it turned out, so I changed gears. Instead, I decided to include pictures of myself and have the squares use the JQueury function "FadeIn" and "FadeOut" to have the squares color pictures when highlighted. I liked the result of this code much more and chose to use it in the final design. <br><br>
            	</p>
                
                <p>
                The total time it took to create the website from start to finish took 10 hours. It's a rather simple site, and I don't think I'm the most talented designer, but am pleased with the result for a first serious attempt at a web design. After implementing the box model I found it a little difficult to properly fit writing into the small spaces, and there's little room for expansion. All in all, I think it was a nice learning experience.<br><br>
